# NextTransit
NextTransit is an Android app that provides fast access to departure times of public transport from your current location to your most-frequently visited places like home, work or university.

## Background
I developed NextTransit in early 2016 and made minor changes throughout the year. In 2018, I reworked the user interface and converted the project to Kotlin. In 2019, I added dependency injection via Dagger and switched to a more reactive pattern with RxJava.
